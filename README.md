# Morsalyzer: Morse code modulation VST plugin

VST effect plugin that modulates an audio signal to the input text interpreted in morse code

This project is still in early development. Currently only the RATE, GAIN, and MSG controls function.

Goals for later development:
* Feature to invert 'on' and 'off' states
* Message resets with silence or with playback start
* Rate can be synchronised with BPM from DAW
* Noticeably bug-free performance
